                <p>A main series Pokémon game is a turn-based RPG (role-playing game), with the player going around and collecting Pokémon to battle with so they can become champion of the Pokémon League.
                In essence, Pokémon battles are similar to rock-paper-scissors. Every Pokémon and Move has a type (or types), that they are strong and weak against. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the Fire-Type Pokemon Charmander is attacked with a water move, the move will be 'super effective!' and deal double damage. If it is hit with a grass move, the move will be 'not very effective!'</li>
                    <li>If the Water-Type Pokemon Squirtle is attacked with a grass move, the move will be 'super effective!' and deal double damage. If it is hit with a fire move, the move will be 'not very effective!'</li> 
                    <li>If the Grass-Type Pokemon Bulbasaur is attacked with a fire move, the move be 'super effective!' and deal double damage. If it is hit with a water move, the move will be 'not very effective!'</li>  
                </ul>
                <p>There are a total 18 Pokemon-types, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and every Pokémon has different abilities, stats
                and moves it can use, making every Pokémon battle a nail-biter!</p>

                <p>Most people are familiar with Pokémon because of its largely popular TV show. It follows the adventure of Ash Ketchum and friends as he travels across
                across the regions, battling Gym Leaders, and competing in the Pokémon League, while meeting new friends and Pokémon along the way.
                The show lived in infamy because Ash, despite placing in every tournament, never won, until the most recent one. Here is a list of his tournament record.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Kanto: Top 16</li>
