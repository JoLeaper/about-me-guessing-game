        <p><span>Chances are that if you've been alive anytime in the last 24 years, you've heard of Pokémon.<span></p> 
        <p>But even if you haven't, I'm here to give you a rundown.</p>
        <div class = 'pokemon-history'>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Pokémon (or Pocket Monsters) is a video game series created in 1996 by the company Game Freak, published by Nintendo.</p>
            <p>Since it's inception, the Pokémon series has gone on to spawn over 120 games, along with several books, movies, comics, toys, and more.</p>

            <h2>How To Play</h2>
            <p>A main series Pokémon game is a turn-based RPG, with the player going around and collecting Pokémon to battle with so they can become champion of the Pokémon League.</p></p>
            <p>In essence, Pokémon battles are similar to rock-paper-scissors. Every Pokémon and Move has a type (or types), that they are strong and weak against. </p>
            <p>For Example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the Fire-Type Pokemon Charmander is attacked with a water move, the move will be 'super effective!' and deal double damage. If it is hit with a grass move, the move will be 'not very effective!'</li>
                <li>If the Water-Type Pokemon Squirtle is attacked with a grass move, the move will be 'super effective!' and deal double damage. If it is hit with a fire move, the move will be 'not very effective!'</li> 
                <li>If the Grass-Type Pokemon Bulbasaur is attacked with a fire move, the move be 'super effective!' and deal double damage. If it is hit with a water move, the move will be 'not very effective!'</li>  
            </ul>
            <p>There are a total 18 Pokemon-types, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and every Pokémon has different abilities, stats </p>
            <p>and moves it can use, making every Pokémon battle a much more strategic game then you'd think!</p>

            <h2>The TV Show</h2>
            <p>Most people are familiar with Pokémon because of its largely popular TV show. It follows the adventure of Ash Ketchum and friends as he travels across</p>
            <p>across the regions, battling Gym Leaders, and competing in the Pokémon League, while meeting new friends and Pokémon along the way.</p>
